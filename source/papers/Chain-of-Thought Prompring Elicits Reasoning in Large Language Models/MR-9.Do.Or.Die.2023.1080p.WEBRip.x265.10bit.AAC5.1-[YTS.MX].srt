00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
공식 YIFY 영화 사이트:
YTS.MX

3
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,713
체크, 체크.
여기는 MR-9입니다.

4
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:24,682
컨트롤, 복사하셨나요?

5
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,785
MR-9. 당신과 연결되었습니다.

6
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,084
복사했습니다.

7
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:40,692
보스, 폭탄이 준비되었습니다.
우리는 곧 가야 합니다.

8
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,617
이봐, 그 담배 쓰레기를
켜줄게.

9
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:43,276
제발!

10
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:45,817
제발!

11
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,720
이봐, 여기 누가 있는지 봐.

12
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,152
아이들이 있어요.
제발 저를 죽이지 마세요.

13
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,659
제발 도와주세요.

14
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,387
- 안녕하세요, 친구들.
제발.

15
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,900
환영한다고 말하고 싶지만,
당신들이 내 파티를 망치려는 게

16
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,496
조금 불편하네요.

17
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,683
어린이를 보내서
남자의 일을 하게 하다니.

18
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,279
당신의 사람들은
내 작전에 대해 무엇을 알고 있나요?

19
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:22,513
도와주세요. 도와주세요.
저를 쏘지 마세요.

20
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,185
안 돼! 오늘 당신은 죽습니다!

21
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,098
오!

22
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,364
아아!

23
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,468
시간이 다 되어가고 있습니다.

24
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:36,356
그가 아는 것을 알아내고
이것을 정리하세요.

25
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,588
그리고 그것도 처리하세요.

26
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,725
지옥에 가세요.

27
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,658
큰 실수입니다!

28
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,165
아아!

29
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,342
MR-9, 당신은
거기서 나가야 합니다.

30
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:43,774
폭탄이 30초 후에 폭발할 것입니다.

31
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,894
가, 가, 가!

32
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,295
가!

33
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,607
미소 지어. 내 아들!

34
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:25,480
역사를 만들 준비가 되었나요?
- 갑시다.

35
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:43,564
어떻게 지내, 작은 형제?
- 보시다시피, 아직 살아 있습니다.

36
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,732
필요한 것이 있나요?

37
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,239
아니요.

38
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,406
당신이 아직 살아 있어서
그저 기쁩니다.

39
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,640
이제 내 마사지 시간입니다.

40
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,151
You want in on this?

41
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:04,255
No, no.
You-you-you do your thing.

42
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:07,588
You relax.
We‘ll talk later.

43
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:28,444
Our early-bird reports
have indicated

44
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:31,282
that our target of interest,
Mr. Subir Shen,

45
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:34,615
will be meeting
with Roman Ross in Las Vegas.

46
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,028
Thanks, Paul.

47
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,460
We need eyes and ears
on the ground ASAP.

48
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,036
I need us to have intel
on all of his known associates.

49
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,336
That‘s it, gentlemen.

50
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:12,977
Everything‘s on schedule.

51
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:14,781
I‘ll be in Vegas on time.

52
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,468
Hello.

53
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,845
Subir!

54
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,753
Get the fuck out!

55
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,883
He is going up.
Duke!

56
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,051
I‘ll make sure
he doesn‘t come down.

57
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,260
Shit!

58
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,396
Subir, stop.
Stop.

59
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,401
Look, I‘m not
trying to hurt you.

60
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:10,765
Just wanna make a deal.

61
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,163
Doesn‘t have to be
anything more than that.

62
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,769
Okay?

63
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,740
All right?

64
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,843
I just need you to come
in with me. We just--

65
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,938
All right, chill the fuck out.
I just need your--

66
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,949
Aahhh!

67
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,473
There goes our Vegas connect.

68
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:28,315
I got a guy
we can recruit from B.C.I.

69
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,648
What, Bangladesh?
- Yep.

70
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,466
Good to see you.

71
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,932
MR-9. Good to see you.

72
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,967
Good to see you, too, sir.

73
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:37,741
This is Paul Taylor, operation
officer from C.I.A.

74
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:38,775
Paul Taylor.

75
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:39,710
Masud Rana.

76
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,449
Nice to finally
meet you in person, MR-9.

77
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,912
Heard a lot of your stories.

78
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:47,982
I read a lot of your case files,
too-- very impressive.

79
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:51,854
Okay, let‘s start
the presentation.

80
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,388
We‘ve come to find out
there were crates of boxes

81
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,895
in the basement of that mansion.

82
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:04,834
Each crate contained high-tech,
robotic explosives and weapons,

83
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,035
and some unidentified material,
as well.

84
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:11,973
The manufacturer
was R&R Robotics.

85
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:14,514
You weren‘t just on a raid.

86
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,945
You slammed right into
the tip of the iceberg.

87
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:20,344
And that‘s why they blew up
that place on that day.

88
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:22,786
They were compromised,
and they did not want us

89
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:25,085
to get a hold of the evidence.

90
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,988
Precisely.

91
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,528
The compound in South Africa

92
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:32,257
was just one of many, internationally.

93
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,161
They‘ve been selling their
weapons in Africa for some time

94
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:39,165
and delivering them
throughout the world, as well.

95
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:42,773
The supplier, again,
appears to be R&R Robotics,

96
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:46,007
owned by celebrity
billionaire Roman Ross

97
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:50,946
and his sideline younger brother
Ricci, who you know very well.

98
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,883
Ricci is the brains
of R&R Robotics.

99
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:57,216
He was also their first
successful experiment, as well.

100
00:21:57,854 --> 00:21:58,789
How so?

101
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,725
Well, the brothers
inherited billions

102
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,320
from their family fortunes.

103
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,159
A couple of years ago, Ricci
developed a rare eye disease.

104
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,900
Caused him to go blind.
After that, he funded a study

105
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,707
that combines stem-cell research
and robotic technology.

106
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:18,974
He now has bionic eyes.

107
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,471
That gives him
superhuman vision.

108
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:22,912
Roman is the face of Ricci‘s

109
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,079
billion-dollar
public corporation.

110
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,148
It‘s just a front for his
international smuggling ring.

111
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:30,821
Right now, the rest
of the world sees Roman Ross

112
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:32,559
as a successful business tycoon

113
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,124
whose technology is doing
great things for the world.

114
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,326
Imagine if Pablo Escobar
did what he did with the guide

115
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:45,099
of a billion-dollar legitimate
business in front of him.

116
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:50,104
Only the B.C.I. and the C.I.A.
know about this at this point.

117
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,437
I know there‘s more
going on behind the curtain.

118
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:57,782
I just hope that we can find out
what it is before it‘s too late.

119
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:06,021
Subir Shen, born into money.

120
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:09,354
Blew his family‘s fortune
on hookers, cocaine, and booze.

121
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,520
You name it.

122
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,027
He was set up in Los Angeles

123
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:15,899
to go undercover for the T.L.F.
as a Bangladeshi national.

124
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,231
He was gonna meet up
with Roman and his guys

125
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,905
and carry out their first
mission into Las Vegas.

126
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:26,140
He died two days ago when my
partner and I got too close.

127
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,649
We were able to cover it up
before the T.L.F. found out.

128
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,345
And this, Sulota Devi.

129
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,920
As dangerous
as she is beautiful.

130
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,792
The T.L.F. has them ready to
meet up in 48 hours in Las Vegas

131
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,992
to carry out their first mission
in the United States.

132
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:45,830
So, now that Subir Shen
is out of the picture?

133
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,295
You step into his shoes.
The T.L.F. has a strict protocol

134
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,803
of not revealing their
agents‘ names to each other

135
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,970
when they‘re on secret missions.

136
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,841
Jointly, they formed
a new terror force,

137
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:01,142
high tech and brute force.
We‘ve got--

138
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:02,913
I‘m in.

139
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,829
Faisal.

140
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:27,261
MR-9!
It‘s good to see you.

141
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:30,165
You are the only few
I can say that about.

142
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:33,267
It‘s hard to
hate the toy maker.

143
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,743
Now, let‘s take a look
at your new toys.

144
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,910
Here‘s your cloning phone.

145
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,176
Set it next to the device
you‘d like to tap.

146
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:45,015
Give the A.I. two minutes
to read the magnetic field,

147
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:50,218
and you‘ll intercept
their calls, text messages,

148
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:56,290
and any signals coming in or out
without them knowing.

149
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,933
I could‘ve used something
like that in my younger days.

150
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:05,266
There‘s a reason
we don‘t hire teenagers

151
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:08,104
anymore, MR-9.

152
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,406
Now, I know you like music.

153
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:18,378
This is a wireless speaker,
but when you push this button...

154
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:23,823
...you get a three-dimensional
surveillance system,

155
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:26,320
stretching 14 floors.

156
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:35,230
I know you‘ve seen
3-D glasses before,

157
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,135
but, uh, you‘re gonna have to
take a look through these.

158
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:49,244
- Security camera?
- Mm, guess again.

159
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:53,512
A security camera
with multifunctional zoom lens?

160
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,448
Mm, closer.

161
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:06,063
Ah! There it is.

162
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:11,662
A micro-surveillance bug
connected to your smart watch.

163
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:15,974
Yes, this thing will, uh,
infiltrate anywhere you‘d like,

164
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:20,275
and it can also
keep you outta trouble,

165
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:21,848
if you know what I mean.

166
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,609
Maybe I like the trouble.
- I‘m sure you do.

167
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,019
Now, I know you like
your Walther PPKs.

168
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,387
Ah! But we have
a modified version of it--

169
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:37,061
the Shadow Systems MR920.

170
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:41,527
All right, this is a
technologically advanced update.

171
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,694
- Update?
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:48,974
How? Laser sight?
- Laser?

173
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:51,207
Does this look like
an antique store to you?

174
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:56,014
This has
a Bluetooth optical sensor

175
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,544
to improve your aim.

176
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,051
I hate Bluetooth.

177
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:02,383
Oh, well, you know,
the other option

178
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:05,892
is to implant a microchip
in your brain.

179
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:10,897
Well, good luck out there, MR-9.

180
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:33,546
Welcome to California, MR-9.
Well, from this point on,

181
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,385
you‘re Subir Shen for
the remainder of this mission.

182
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:41,026
You‘re due in Las Vegas
in nine hours

183
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:44,524
to pick up Sulota Devi
from the airport.

184
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:47,362
From there, you two are set
to attend a private event

185
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:51,432
given at Roman Ross‘ house
later this evening.

186
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,533
I suggest you be careful.

187
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:59,341
Remember, you get compromised,
we don‘t know you.

188
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:04,379
two of our field officers
will pick you up.

189
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:08,647
Sam and Bobby will make all
your arrangements on our behalf.

190
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,716
They‘re gonna escort you
out to the safe house

191
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,960
in the Mojave Desert.

192
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,962
Copy that.

193
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,600
MR-9, this is your safe house.

194
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,636
You‘ll be able to stay here for
the duration of your mission.

195
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,541
You‘ll have everything
you need inside the house

196
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,048
and the trailer.

197
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:15,813
Thank you, Bobby.
Thank you, Sam.

198
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:18,783
If there‘s anything else
you need from us, let us know.

199
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,027
We‘ll be around.
- Got it.

200
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,230
Let‘s go.

201
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,888
Are we good?
- Yeah.

202
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,428
Hello.

203
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:34,056
How are you?

204
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:37,026
Hi, sweetheart.
I‘m good. And you?

205
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,434
Just need to make sure

206
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:41,272
that we don‘t have
another rogue situation.

207
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,539
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

208
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,277
Did you have a nice flight?

209
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:49,610
Wonderful flight.
I slept for eight hours.

210
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,546
Beautiful. Let‘s go.

211
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,388
Thank you.
- My lady.

212
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,631
I appreciate that.
- Thank you, sir.

213
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,384
Excuse me.

214
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,047
It is not only my honor

215
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:43,361
but my privilege to introduce
Roman Ross!

216
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,682
Welcome.

217
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:11,356
Welcome, welcome.
Thank you all for being here.

218
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,986
Why are we here?
Why did I ask you here?

219
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,858
I wanna talk
about disabilities.

220
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:23,599
Disabilities no longer
need to be a challenge.

221
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:29,704
What you see here
are my hands, yeah?

222
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:34,610
What you don‘t see
is the technology.

223
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,949
People take for granted
what other people don‘t have.

224
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,988
Their eyesight, their hearing,
legs, arms, hands, all of it.

225
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,793
It sucks.
Believe me, I know.

226
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,700
Play a game with me.
Close your eyes.

227
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,639
Keep ‘em closed tight.
Don‘t let any light in.

228
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,878
Now imagine life
like this every day.

229
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:16,883
Day in, day out in the dark.

230
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:20,249
Never seeing a loved one,
never seeing your children.

231
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,462
Sunrise, sunset,
the food in front of your face.

232
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:27,729
Every single day the same.

233
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,338
All right, open ‘em.

234
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,673
And then human innovation
comes along,

235
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:42,040
and it defies everything
you thought was possible.

236
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:46,583
You can see.
You can walk. You can hear.

237
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,917
R&R Robotics is your future.

238
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:58,859
R&R Robotics eliminates
all disabilities.

239
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:05,294
You heard me right--
all disabilities.

240
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:09,067
Not only for humans,
but for animals.

241
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,772
Imagine that.

242
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:20,650
R&R combines robotic technology
with human and animal biology.

243
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:27,756
No more disabilities, no more
blindness, no more wheelchairs.

244
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:35,159
R&R Robotics is your future.

245
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:56,015
- Cheers.

246
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:59,117
Is that a blue sapphire
from Kashmir?

247
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:05,189
Impressive. That‘s not
a common knowledge, though.

248
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,434
Well, I think of myself
as uncommon.

249
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,601
Really?

250
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,971
So, Mr. Shen,
what makes you say that?

251
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,712
That‘s for you to figure out,
ma‘am.

252
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:26,518
I will definitely
figure it out, then.

253
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,658
Uh, excuse me. I need to go
to the ladies‘ washroom.

254
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:37,188
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

255
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,001
Good evening, gentlemen.

256
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:23,003
Devi.

257
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,041
The package.

258
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:36,621
The funds are being
transferred as we speak.

259
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:40,119
Oh, Roman, thank you.
You know I trust you.

260
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,595
Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

261
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,194
Boss, it‘s empty.

262
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:54,639
- Devi.
- Come on, Roman.

263
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,576
Check underneath.
You‘ll find it.

264
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:06,915
Very good.

265
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,824
All right, thank you, gentlemen.

266
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:16,661
I better be get going.

267
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:20,060
No, no, no, no.
Not yet.

268
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:24,999
Where is the boyfriend?

269
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:27,606
Firstly,
he‘s not my boyfriend.

270
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,773
And, secondly,
I left him long back.

271
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:33,172
Okay.
Can we wrap this up, please?

272
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:34,338
We got this.

273
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,077
Well, you do whatever
you gotta do here.

274
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,947
Just keep it clean.

275
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:40,718
We already have
enough heat on us.

276
00:39:40,718 --> 00:39:42,016
Oh, I think I can
handle it, little brother.

277
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:44,447
Why don‘t you get
another massage?

278
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:47,252
Let the, uh, grownups
take care of business.

279
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:51,289
Call me when you
clean this up.

280
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,035
Okay, okay, I‘m leaving.
I‘m leaving.

281
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,268
Well, thanks for letting me
use the bathroom.

282
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,776
Little too much champagne,
you know.

283
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:08,713
Oh, and can you tell
your boss, Roman Ross,

284
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:10,880
that was a hell of a party.

285
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,982
Night, pretty boy.

286
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:26,126
Okay, all set.
I got it in place.

287
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:30,130
- And where‘d you put it?
- Behind the toilet, like always.

288
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,737
- What?

289
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,069
So, like last time,

290
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:37,599
we literally have to listen
to shit all night.

291
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,010
Yeah, that, uh,
didn‘t work out so well.

292
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,881
What?

293
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,720
You crossed the wrong line, bro.

294
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,119
Get in there!

295
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:30,256
Oh, look what
the cat dragged in.

296
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,029
You are gonna take a nap.

297
00:42:09,658 --> 00:42:10,659
What is that?

298
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,996
What is this?

299
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:58,113
Who... do... you... work... for?

300
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,616
Devi!

301
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:17,330
You want to explain this?

302
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,398
I have no idea.

303
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:30,739
Why are you doing this?
Just tell me who you work for.

304
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,820
Can I leave now?
- No.

305
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,824
No.

306
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:50,330
If you take me as hostage,

307
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,872
your precious detonators
won‘t be delivered.

308
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:57,238
So, you decide.
What do you want?

309
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:04,575
Go.

310
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,579
Thank you.
- Devi.

311
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,388
You fuck me,
I‘ll kill you myself.

312
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,030
Okay.

313
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:23,198
I‘ll walk you out, okay?

314
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:53,492
Who?

315
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,135
Make him talk.

316
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,973
Aahhh!

317
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:04,404
Aah!

318
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:31,530
Fuck!

319
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:43,926
Let’s go, Masud!

320
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,816
Let’s go, Masud!

321
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,093
Come on!

322
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:24,373
Come on!

323
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:31,710
Shh.

324
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:45,658
Yeah. I‘m so tired now.

325
00:50:15,385 --> 00:50:21,325
Masud Rana. B.C.I. agent.
Code name, MR-9.

326
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:23,987
I was sent in Subir Shen‘s place

327
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:27,760
to investigate the T.L.F.‘s
relationship with R&R.

328
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:31,929
Isn‘t that
what he wanted to know?

329
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,460
- Oh!

330
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,363
Aah!

331
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,762
We‘ve been breached.

332
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:12,002
Let‘s go.
Let‘s charge in.

333
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,649
Go! Go!

334
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:28,887
I have traps planted
all over the property.

335
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:30,889
That should slow them down.

336
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,152
Aah!

337
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,500
Remember me?

338
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:29,672
Get off me, bitch!

339
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:51,050
Oh, I see.
Spies spying on a spy.

340
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:52,986
Well, we needed to make sure

341
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:56,319
you weren‘t as compromised
as Subir.

342
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,123
Lucky for you, right?

343
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,329
Rana, they‘re planning
something very big this time.

344
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:08,837
They will meet at a private
underground gambling club.

345
00:56:08,837 --> 00:56:10,333
I know where.

346
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,776
What makes you think they will
meet with all this going on?

347
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:16,438
For one,

348
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:19,177
they must acquire those last
set of detonators.

349
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,783
You trust her?

350
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,412
Let‘s move.

351
00:58:05,151 --> 00:58:06,889
Cover me.

352
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:12,829
Nabonita.
Roger that.

353
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:15,425
On the target to...
Okay, follow.

354
00:58:22,135 --> 00:58:25,435
Hold on. Stand by.
Be careful.

355
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:02,274
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
No, no, no, no.

356
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:12,922
Cross the road slowly.
Keep up with the situation--

357
00:59:12,922 --> 00:59:16,761
Shit! Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

358
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,226
Okay, let‘s go.
- Okay.

359
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,845
Don‘t move!

360
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,153
Move, move!

361
01:00:43,276 --> 01:00:49,051
Get down. I said, get down!
Get down! Get it. Get it.

362
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:50,349
Hey!

363
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:54,188
Just keep quiet.

364
01:00:58,621 --> 01:00:59,897
Come on!
Come on!

365
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:01,932
Get out of our way!
- Come on!

366
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:13,504
- Still hurt?
- Yeah, it still hurts.

367
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,044
Ah! Easy.

368
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:17,882
I‘m trying.
- Easy.

369
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,714
Pretty good work.

370
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:27,991
Got banged up, huh?

371
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,928
Unh-unh. Unh-unh-unh.

372
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:33,458
You don‘t drink
before the old man.

373
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:39,068
Thank you, love.

374
01:01:39,761 --> 01:01:41,268
I‘ll be back later.

375
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,952
What‘s on your mind?

376
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:56,745
Nothing.

377
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:03,092
Nothing? ‘Cause I can feel it.
What‘s on your mind?

378
01:02:05,193 --> 01:02:06,623
Why don‘t you let me
take this one?

379
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,428
No, no, no. No way.

380
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:11,694
You‘ve got enough on your
plate, and after this--

381
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,499
No fucking way.
It‘s too dangerous.

382
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:17,469
I should‘ve been there.
I could‘ve...

383
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,009
You could‘ve...

384
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:23,211
You could what?

385
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:26,379
You could’ve what?
You could’ve died?

386
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:35,993
You don‘t need that.

387
01:02:42,164 --> 01:02:45,497
I‘m ready to take on
some of the weight.

388
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:49,666
I need this, please.

389
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,541
Lal Sharma.
He is here?

390
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,577
Inside.
Bruno has the whistle ready.

391
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:37,186
Okay. Bring out
the little boss, it’s time.

392
01:03:37,186 --> 01:03:38,517
Copy.

393
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:12,188
So, where is your daddy?

394
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:14,751
Uh, I‘m taking the reign
on this one.

395
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:06,671
- Your party‘s over.
- And who might you be?

396
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,904
Don‘t worry.
You‘ll have plenty of time

397
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:11,346
to get to know me
where you‘re going.

398
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:22,357
Excuse me one second.

399
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:29,298
Duke.

400
01:05:29,298 --> 01:05:31,894
Well, it‘s not over till
the fat lady sings.

401
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:14,376
Get Jason and go.

402
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:15,608
Copy.

403
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:19,678
Yakub!

404
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:21,911
Let‘s go.

405
01:06:22,615 --> 01:06:24,848
Get me out of here.

406
01:06:39,368 --> 01:06:42,734
- Stay down. Stay with me.

407
01:06:58,486 --> 01:06:59,949
Oh!

408
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:42,524
Aah!

409
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,775
Come on, man.

410
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:05,382
Brah.

411
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:29,065
Okay?

412
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:42,144
We‘re gonna need
cleanup on location.

413
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:56,026
Now, I‘m gonna give you
a chance

414
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,929
you don‘t give anybody else.

415
01:09:57,929 --> 01:10:01,669
I don‘t know. Maybe it‘s that
red dress at Roman‘s party.

416
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:04,705
But if you want to end this
right now, I can.

417
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:07,972
- But tell me something.

418
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:11,338
Why the hell would you fight
for a man

419
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:14,044
who would just leave you to die?

420
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:20,050
Yeah, I‘m out.

421
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:37,936
Tell him I‘m sorry!
I‘m sorry.

422
01:10:37,936 --> 01:10:39,773
I‘m sorry. I‘m sorry. I‘m sorry.

423
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:42,941
- Fuck!

424
01:10:57,384 --> 01:11:00,794
- Fuck!
- Yakub! Yakub! Ah!

425
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:06,030
Yakub.

426
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,236
Fuck you!

427
01:11:19,813 --> 01:11:20,880
Fuck.

428
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,154
Damn it!
Fuck!

429
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:36,599
And fuck you!
- Shit!

430
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:40,669
Fuck, man.
I am so sorry.

431
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:03,114
I am so sorry, boss.

432
01:13:09,087 --> 01:13:11,254
He doesn‘t die in vain.

433
01:13:14,763 --> 01:13:19,933
You focus on what‘s ahead and
let me take care of the rest.

434
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:24,938
Mr. Ricci is missing.
We lost him at the club.

435
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:29,943
I think they got him, boss.
I‘m so sorry.

436
01:13:33,474 --> 01:13:36,785
We do this my way now.
- Okay, boss.

437
01:13:36,785 --> 01:13:38,952
You stick to the plan.

438
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,054
Go ahead.

439
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:55,738
MR-9, after
interrogating Raju Roy,

440
01:13:55,738 --> 01:13:58,499
he gave us a name,
Kabir Chowdury.

441
01:13:58,499 --> 01:13:59,742
He also disclosed their target

442
01:13:59,742 --> 01:14:02,074
to be water dams
around the world.

443
01:14:02,074 --> 01:14:05,847
MR-9, we were not able to find
any individual

444
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:09,444
named Kabir Chowdury
with connection to Roman Ross

445
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:11,182
and his operations.

446
01:14:11,182 --> 01:14:12,755
And Devi?

447
01:14:12,755 --> 01:14:15,417
Sorry, MR-9.
We cannot locate her.

448
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,254
MR-9.

449
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,589
All right.

450
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:26,230
You must go to
the Hoover Dam now.

451
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:37,912
Mr. Rana,
this is our hydrologist.

452
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:40,783
Dr. Abdul Karim.

453
01:14:42,147 --> 01:14:43,687
Masud Rana.

454
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:48,857
Nice to meet you, Mr. Rana.
You‘re from Bangladesh.

455
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,970
Oh, that‘s right.
Roman Ross‘ party.

456
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,302
You were there that night.
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:11,110
I was there, uh, because I have
some contract with R&R Robotics.

458
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:16,016
For that I have been there
for a V.I.P. presentation.

459
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:18,546
So, why
you are here?

460
01:15:18,546 --> 01:15:20,053
Oh, I‘m with the B.C.I.

461
01:15:20,053 --> 01:15:24,222
I‘m here to investigate
some of Roman Ross‘ operations.

462
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:28,424
B.C.I. investigation.

463
01:15:47,113 --> 01:15:48,246
Thank you. One sec.

464
01:15:48,246 --> 01:15:53,119
Mr. Larson, uh, I‘ll meet you
at the control center, okay?

465
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,122
Uh, let me take
Mr. Rana with me.

466
01:15:57,893 --> 01:15:59,455
Sounds good.
- Yeah.

467
01:16:23,644 --> 01:16:27,285
What is this place?
- Oh.

468
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:36,327
I know the place
because I designed that lab.

469
01:16:36,327 --> 01:16:42,399
Yes. Come on. Get out.
I‘m showing you.

470
01:17:28,951 --> 01:17:31,184
Come on.

471
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:40,897
Yeah. Yeah, we are almost,
almost here, right?

472
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:42,932
We are almost there.

473
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:46,199
We have to climb down.

474
01:17:50,335 --> 01:17:51,798
We have to go down.

475
01:17:51,798 --> 01:17:55,043
Go, go, go.
Go on.

476
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:09,288
Entrance is in that way.
Okay? Come.

477
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:24,006
We have to go there.

478
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,313
Don‘t you move, asshole.

479
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:37,184
What‘s going on?!

480
01:18:39,879 --> 01:18:41,056
Put your gun down

481
01:18:41,056 --> 01:18:43,454
or your friend gets it
in his fucking head.

482
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:47,326
Put your gun down.
Let‘s go.

483
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:55,268
This is Keaton.
We got him.

484
01:18:55,763 --> 01:18:57,699
Move! Move!
- O-okay.

485
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,701
Move. Move.

486
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,439
Don‘t be nice to them.

487
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:02,605
Move!

488
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:20,293
We‘re clear.

489
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:32,008
What the
hell was that?

490
01:19:34,142 --> 01:19:37,112
Just a minor jam.
We‘ll run our diagnostic.

491
01:19:37,112 --> 01:19:38,674
I thought that thing
was finished.

492
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:41,908
These things happen, sir.
I‘ll get my men right on it.

493
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:55,724
We‘re fired up.

494
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:07,043
Move! Move! Move!
Let‘s go.

495
01:20:18,186 --> 01:20:22,058
Move!
Move. Sit down.

496
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:41,770
Welcome, Masud Rana.

497
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:58,490
Now we‘re gonna
do things my way.

498
01:21:00,987 --> 01:21:05,530
Karim.
Who are these fucking guys?

499
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:10,106
You know what? You brought me
into this project.

500
01:21:10,106 --> 01:21:13,373
You were treacherous,
treasonous--

501
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:14,737
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

502
01:21:14,737 --> 01:21:15,606
Yes!

503
01:21:19,005 --> 01:21:23,515
Sit! Sit!
You!

504
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:33,525
You know, you know,
this guy, the war guy,

505
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:36,396
he‘s talking, a lot.

506
01:21:41,203 --> 01:21:42,699
Thanks.
- Sure.

507
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:43,931
Welcome.

508
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:47,770
Welcome to the world
of Kabir Chowdury.

509
01:21:50,278 --> 01:21:52,478
How could you
betray your country?

510
01:21:53,215 --> 01:21:58,154
Easy. It‘s very easy
to betray something

511
01:21:58,154 --> 01:22:01,014
that turned its back on you.

512
01:22:01,322 --> 01:22:04,050
I could have been
a national treasure,

513
01:22:04,556 --> 01:22:11,090
but now I work
for the revolutionaries,

514
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:14,170
like Roman Nicholas Ross.

515
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:19,406
This government
you work for...

516
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,774
do not care
about any of us.

517
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,315
They act like it.

518
01:22:37,325 --> 01:22:40,592
The B.C.I. and C.I.A.
know your location.

519
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:44,530
Keeping me alive
was your biggest mistake.

520
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,471
Okay, Duke, go in.

521
01:23:08,015 --> 01:23:09,621
Engage.

522
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:07,316
Move. Move.

523
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:16,919
Get up.
You, get up. Let‘s go.

524
01:24:48,115 --> 01:24:49,622
Take this.

525
01:24:51,327 --> 01:24:54,396
Go outside. Find some cover.

526
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:56,596
I‘m not leaving you.

527
01:24:56,596 --> 01:25:00,831
I have to go after Roman.
You go outside. Find shelter.

528
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:02,734
I‘ll come find you.
I‘ll come find you.

529
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:05,902
- I‘m coming with you.
- I promise. I‘ll find you.

530
01:25:05,902 --> 01:25:07,035
You will?

531
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:20,851
Okay, let‘s go.
Move. Move.

532
01:25:20,851 --> 01:25:22,457
- Is it-- is it safe?
- We‘re going to safety.

533
01:25:22,457 --> 01:25:24,657
- Right.
- Stay here. I’ll go back.

534
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:29,497
It‘s a safe place. Hey, Yakub!
Ya?

535
01:25:43,841 --> 01:25:45,040
Yes.

536
01:27:52,508 --> 01:27:54,169
Bombs are armed.

537
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:03,145
Help me!

538
01:28:03,585 --> 01:28:06,522
- Is he okay?
- Yeah. Help me.

539
01:28:11,923 --> 01:28:16,257
My leg.

540
01:29:02,644 --> 01:29:05,977
It‘s done, Ross.
You dropped something.

541
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,557
Really?

542
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:17,153
Why?
- Once.

543
01:29:22,092 --> 01:29:23,489
Okay.

544
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,649
Ouch.

545
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:45,115
Come on, Duke. Come on!

546
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:08,204
Duke, go now.

547
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:12,010
- Go.

548
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:36,496
Thirty seconds.

549
01:30:36,496 --> 01:30:38,564
Come on, Duke.
Come on.

550
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:46,649
Disarm the bomb.

551
01:30:47,914 --> 01:30:49,410
Easy. Easy.

552
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:25,017
Okay, the bomb‘s disarmed.
Good job, team.

553
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:23,474
As we already know,
Roland Ross,

554
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:26,081
the patriarch
of the Ross family empire,

555
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:28,974
has been secretly locked up
by your government for years

556
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:31,614
until recently escaping.

557
01:37:32,153 --> 01:37:35,387
So far, we‘ve managed
to keep this under tight wraps,

558
01:37:36,014 --> 01:37:37,653
but you know as well as I do,

559
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:40,458
it‘s just a matter of time
before his presence is felt.

560
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:44,330
We‘re asking for World War III
if we don‘t stop him now.

561
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:47,399
Our intel sources tell us
he‘s taken up refuge

562
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:49,830
in an underground facility
in the Himalayans

563
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:54,604
near your border with India.
I need eyes on that location.

564
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:40,617
