      "1. **RER B Train**: The most convenient and cost-effective way is to take the RER B train from CDG to Paris city center. From the airport, follow the signs to the RER B station (Terminal 2). Take the train towards Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse and get off at Denfert-Rochereau or Cité Universitaire stations. From there, take a taxi or bus (see below) to the Eiffel Tower.\n",
      "\t* Cost: €10.30 (one-way)\n",
      "\t* Frequency: Trains run every 10-15 minutes\n",
      "2. **Le Bus Direct**: This is a direct bus service from CDG to Paris city center. The journey takes around 1 hour, depending on traffic. You can catch the bus at Terminal 2 or Terminal 3.\n",
      "\t* Cost: €17 (one-way)\n",
      "\t* Frequency: Buses run every 20-30 minutes\n",
      "3. **TGV Train**: Another option is to take a TGV train from CDG to Paris Montparnasse station, then transfer to the RER C train to Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel station.\n",
      "\t* Cost: €25 (one-way)\n",
      "\t* Frequency: Trains run every 30-60 minutes\n",
      "4. **Taxi**: If you prefer a door-to-door service, you can take a taxi from CDG to the Eiffel Tower. This will be more expensive than public transportation, but convenient if you have a lot of luggage.\n",
      "\t* Cost: around €50-60 (depending on traffic)\n",
      "5. **Private Transfer or Shuttle**: You can also book a private transfer or shuttle service from CDG to your hotel or the Eiffel Tower. These services are available online and can be more expensive than public transportation.\n",

      "Please note that prices may vary depending on the time of day, traffic, and other factors. I recommend checking the schedules and prices for each option before you travel.\n",
