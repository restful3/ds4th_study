langchain v1.2.0
create_agent: Simplified support for provider-specific tool parameters and definitions via a new extras attribute on tools. Examples:
Provider-specific configuration such as Anthropic’s programmatic tool calling and tool search.
Built-in tools that are executed client-side, as supported by Anthropic, OpenAI, and other providers.
Support for strict schema-adherence in agent response_format (see ProviderStrategy docs).

langchain-google-genai v4.0.0
We’ve re-written the Google GenAI integration to use Google’s consolidated Generative AI SDK, which provides access to the Gemini API and Vertex AI Platform under the same interface. This includes minimal breaking changes as well as deprecated packages in langchain-google-vertexai.
See the full release notes and migration guide for details.

langchain v1.1.0
Model profiles: Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a .profile attribute. These data are derived from models.dev, an open source project providing model capability data.
Summarization middleware: Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for context-aware summarization.
Structured output: ProviderStrategy support (native structured output) can now be inferred from model profiles.
SystemMessage for create_agent: Support for passing SystemMessage instances directly to create_agent’s system_prompt parameter, enabling advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks.
Model retry middleware: New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with configurable exponential backoff.
Content moderation middleware: OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and tool results.
