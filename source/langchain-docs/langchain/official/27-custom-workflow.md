# Custom workflow

In the **custom workflow** architecture, you define your own bespoke execution flow using LangGraph. You have complete control over the graph structure—including sequential steps, conditional branches, loops, and parallel execution.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input([Input]) --> Conditional{Conditional}
    Conditional -->|path_a| DeterministicStep[Deterministic step]
    Conditional -->|path_b| AgenticStep((Agentic step))
    DeterministicStep --> Output([Output])
    AgenticStep --> Output
```

## Key characteristics

- Complete control over graph structure
- Mix deterministic logic with agentic behavior
- Support for sequential steps, conditional branches, loops, and parallel execution
- Embed other patterns as nodes in your workflow

## When to use

Use custom workflows when standard patterns (subagents, skills, etc.) don't fit your requirements, you need to mix deterministic logic with agentic behavior, or your use case requires complex routing or multi-stage processing.

Each node in your workflow can be a simple function, an LLM call, or an entire **agent** with **tools**. You can also compose other architectures within a custom workflow—for example, embedding a multi-agent system as a single node.

For a complete example of a custom workflow, see the tutorial below.

> The router pattern is an example of a custom workflow. This tutorial walks through building a router that queries GitHub, Notion, and Slack in parallel, then synthesizes results.

## Basic implementation

The core insight is that you can call a LangChain agent directly inside any LangGraph node, combining the flexibility of custom workflows with the convenience of pre-built agents:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

agent = create_agent(model="openai:gpt-4.1", tools=[...])

def agent_node(state: State) -> dict:
    """A LangGraph node that invokes a LangChain agent."""
    result = agent.invoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": state["query"]}]
    })
    return {"answer": result["messages"][-1].content}

# Build a simple workflow
workflow = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node("agent", agent_node)
    .add_edge(START, "agent")
    .add_edge("agent", END)
    .compile()
)
```

## Example: RAG pipeline

A common use case is combining retrieval with an agent. This example builds a WNBA stats assistant that retrieves from a knowledge base and can fetch live news.

<summary>Custom RAG workflow</summary>

The workflow demonstrates three types of nodes:

- **Model node (Rewrite)**: Rewrites the user query for better retrieval using structured output.
- **Deterministic node (Retrieve)**: Performs vector similarity search — no LLM involved.
- **Agent node (Agent)**: Reasons over retrieved context and can fetch additional information via tools.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Query([Query]) --> Rewrite([Rewrite])
    Rewrite --> Retrieve([Retrieve])
    Retrieve --> Agent([Agent])
    Agent --> Response([Response])
```

You can use LangGraph state to pass information between workflow steps. This allows each part of your workflow to read and update structured fields, making it easy to share data and context across nodes.

```python
from typing import TypedDict
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

    response = agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]})
    return {"answer": response["messages"][-1].content_blocks}
