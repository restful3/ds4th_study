# Human-in-the-loop

The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) [**middleware**](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/overview) lets you add human oversight to agent tool calls. When a model proposes an action that might require review — for example, writing to a file or executing SQL — the middleware can pause execution and wait for a decision.

It does this by checking each tool call against a configurable policy. If intervention is needed, the middleware issues an [**interrupt**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/interrupts/) that halts execution. The graph state is saved using LangGraph's [**persistence layer**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), so execution can pause safely and resume later.

A human decision then determines what happens next: the action can be approved as-is (`approve`), modified before running (`edit`), or rejected with feedback (`reject`).

## Interrupt decision types

The [middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/overview) defines three built-in ways a human can respond to an interrupt:

| Decision Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| ✅ `approve` | The action is approved as-is and executed without changes. | Send an email draft exactly as written |
| ✏️ `edit` | The tool call is executed with modifications. | Change the recipient before sending an email |
| ❌ `reject` | The tool call is rejected, with an explanation added to the conversation. | Reject an email draft and explain how to rewrite it |

The available decision types for each tool depend on the policy you configure in `interrupt_on`. When multiple tool calls are paused at the same time, each action requires a separate decision. Decisions must be provided in the same order as the actions appear in the interrupt request.

> [!TIP]
> When **editing** tool arguments, make changes conservatively. Significant modifications to the original arguments may cause the model to re-evaluate its approach and potentially execute the tool multiple times or take unexpected actions.

## Configuring interrupts

To use HITL, add the middleware to the agent's middleware list when creating the agent. You configure it with a mapping of tool actions to the decision types that are allowed for each action. The middleware will interrupt execution when a tool call matches an action in the mapping.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

agent = create_agent(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[write_file_tool, execute_sql_tool, read_data_tool],
    middleware=[
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(
            interrupt_on={
                "write_file": True,  # All decisions (approve, edit, reject) allowed
                "execute_sql": {"allowed_decisions": ["approve", "reject"]},  # No editing allowed
                # Safe operation, no approval needed
                "read_data": False,
            },
            # Prefix for interrupt messages - combined with tool name and args to form the full message
            # e.g., "Tool execution pending approval: execute_sql with query='DELETE FROM...'"
            # Individual tools can override this by specifying a "description" in their interrupt config
            description_prefix="Tool execution pending approval",
        ),
    ],
    # Human-in-the-loop requires checkpointing to handle interrupts.
    # In production, use a persistent checkpointer like AsyncPostgresSaver.
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)
```

> [!INFO]
> You must configure a **checkpointer** to persist the graph state across interrupts. In production, use a persistent checkpointer like `AsyncPostgresSaver`. For testing or prototyping, use `InMemorySaver`.

When invoking the agent, pass a `config` that includes the thread ID to associate execution with a conversation thread. See the [LangGraph interrupts documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/interrupts/) for details.

### Configuration options

#### `interrupt_on`

| Type | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `dict` | required | Mapping of tool names to approval configs. Values can be `True` (interrupt with default config), `False` (auto-approve), or an `InterruptOnConfig` object. |

#### `description_prefix`

| Type | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `string` | `"Tool execution requires approval"` | Prefix for action request descriptions |

### InterruptOnConfig options

#### `allowed_decisions`

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list[string]` | List of allowed decisions: `'approve'`, `'edit'`, or `'reject'` |

#### `description`

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `string` \| `callable` | Static string or callable function for custom description |

## Responding to interrupts

When you invoke the agent, it runs until it either completes or an interrupt is raised. An interrupt is triggered when a tool call matches the policy you configured in `interrupt_on`.

In that case, the invocation result will include an `__interrupt__` field with the actions that require review. You can then present those actions to a reviewer and resume execution once decisions are provided.

```python
from langgraph.types import Command

# Human-in-the-loop leverages LangGraph's persistence layer.
# You must provide a thread ID to associate the execution with a conversation thread,
# so the conversation can be paused and resumed (as is needed for human review).
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}

# Run the graph until the interrupt is hit.
result = agent.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Delete old records from the database",
            }
        ]
    },
    config=config
)

# The interrupt contains the full HITL request with action_requests and review_configs
print(result['__interrupt__'])
# > [
# >     Interrupt(
# >         value={
# >             'action_requests': [
# >                 {
# >                     'name': 'execute_sql',
# >                     'arguments': {'query': 'DELETE FROM records WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL \'30 days\';'},
# >                     'description': 'Tool execution pending approval\n\nTool: execute_sql\nArgs: {...}'
# >                 }
# >             ],
# >             'review_configs': [
# >                 {
# >                     'action_name': 'execute_sql',
# >                     'allowed_decisions': ['approve', 'reject']
# >                 }
# >             ]
# >         }
# >     )
# > ]

# Resume with approval decision
agent.invoke(
    Command(
        resume={"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}  # or "reject"
    ),
    config=config  # Same thread ID to resume the paused conversation
)
```

### Decision types

#### ✅ approve

Use `approve` to approve the tool call as-is and execute it without changes.

```python
agent.invoke(
    Command(
        # Decisions are provided as a list, one per action under review.
        # The order of decisions must match the order of actions
        # listed in the `__interrupt__` request.
        resume={
            "decisions": [
                {
                    "type": "approve",
                }
            ]
        }
    ),
    config=config  # Same thread ID to resume the paused conversation
)
```

#### ✏️ edit

Use `edit` to modify the tool call before execution. Provide the edited action with the new tool name and arguments.

```python
agent.invoke(
    Command(
        # Decisions are provided as a list, one per action under review.
        # The order of decisions must match the order of actions
        # listed in the `__interrupt__` request.
        resume={
            "decisions": [
                {
                    "type": "edit",
                    # Edited action with tool name and args
                    "edited_action": {
                        # Tool name to call.
                        # Will usually be the same as the original action.
                        "name": "new_tool_name",
                        # Arguments to pass to the tool.
                        "args": {"key1": "new_value", "key2": "original_value"},
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ),
    config=config  # Same thread ID to resume the paused conversation
)
```

> [!TIP]
> When **editing** tool arguments, make changes conservatively. Significant modifications to the original arguments may cause the model to re-evaluate its approach and potentially execute the tool multiple times or take unexpected actions.

#### ❌ reject

Use `reject` to reject the tool call and provide feedback instead of execution.

```python
agent.invoke(
    Command(
        # Decisions are provided as a list, one per action under review.
        # The order of decisions must match the order of actions
        # listed in the `__interrupt__` request.
        resume={
            "decisions": [
                {
                    "type": "reject",
                    # An explanation about why the action was rejected
                    "message": "No, this is wrong because ..., instead do this ...",
                }
            ]
        }
    ),
    config=config  # Same thread ID to resume the paused conversation
)
```

The message is added to the conversation as feedback to help the agent understand why the action was rejected and what it should do instead.

### Multiple decisions

When multiple actions are under review, provide a decision for each action in the same order as they appear in the interrupt:

```python
{
    "decisions": [
        {"type": "approve"},
        {
            "type": "edit",
            "edited_action": {
                "name": "tool_name",
                "args": {"param": "new_value"}
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "reject",
            "message": "This action is not allowed"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Streaming with human-in-the-loop

You can use `stream()` instead of `invoke()` to get real-time updates while the agent runs and handles interrupts. Use `stream_mode=['updates', 'messages']` to stream both agent progress and LLM tokens.

```python
from langgraph.types import Command

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}

# Stream agent progress and LLM tokens until interrupt
for mode, chunk in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Delete old records from the database"}]},
    config=config,
    stream_mode=["updates", "messages"],
):
    if mode == "messages":
        # LLM token
        token, metadata = chunk
        if token.content:
            print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
    elif mode == "updates":
        # Check for interrupt
        if "__interrupt__" in chunk:
            print(f"\n\nInterrupt: {chunk['__interrupt__']}")

# Resume with streaming after human decision
for mode, chunk in agent.stream(
    Command(resume={"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}),
    config=config,
    stream_mode=["updates", "messages"],
):
    if mode == "messages":
        token, metadata = chunk
        if token.content:
            print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
```

See the [Streaming guide](/oss/python/langchain/streaming) for more details on stream modes.

## Execution lifecycle

The middleware defines an `after_model` hook that runs after the model generates a response but before any tool calls are executed:

1. The agent invokes the model to generate a response.
2. The middleware inspects the response for tool calls.
3. If any calls require human input, the middleware builds a `HITLRequest` with `action_requests` and `review_configs` and calls `interrupt`.
4. The agent waits for human decisions.
5. Based on the `HITLResponse` decisions, the middleware executes approved or edited calls, synthesizes `ToolMessage`'s for rejected calls, and resumes execution.

## Custom HITL logic

For more specialized workflows, you can build custom HITL logic directly using the [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/interrupts/) primitive and [middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/overview) abstraction. Review the [execution lifecycle](#execution-lifecycle) above to understand how to integrate interrupts into the agent's operation.
