Use the graph API

Copy page

This guide demonstrates the basics of LangGraph’s Graph API. It walks through state, as well as composing common graph structures such as sequences, branches, and loops. It also covers LangGraph’s control features, including the Send API for map-reduce workflows and the Command API for combining state updates with “hops” across nodes.

Define and update state
Here we show how to define and update state in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:
How to use state to define a graph’s schema
How to use reducers to control how state updates are processed.
​
Define state
State in LangGraph can be a TypedDict, Pydantic model, or dataclass. Below we will use TypedDict. See this section for detail on using Pydantic.
By default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See this section for how to define distinct input and output schemas.
Let’s consider a simple example using messages. This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our concepts page for more detail.
from langchain.messages import AnyMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: list[AnyMessage]
    extra_field: int
This state tracks a list of message objects, as well as an extra integer field.
​
Update state
Let’s build an example graph with a single node. Our node is just a Python function that reads our graph’s state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:
from langchain.messages import AIMessage

def node(state: State):
    messages = state["messages"]
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": messages + [new_message], "extra_field": 10}
This node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.
Nodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.
Let’s next define a simple graph containing this node. We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use add_node populate our graph.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(node)
builder.set_entry_point("node")
graph = builder.compile()
LangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let’s inspect our graph. See this section for detail on visualization.
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Simple graph with single node
In this case, our graph just executes a single node. Let’s proceed with a simple invocation:
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})
result
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi'), AIMessage(content='Hello!')], 'extra_field': 10}
Note that:
We kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.
We receive the entire state in the invocation result.
For convenience, we frequently inspect the content of message objects via pretty-print:
for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
​
Process state updates with reducers
Each key in the state can have its own independent reducer function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.
For TypedDict state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.
In the earlier example, our node updated the "messages" key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:
from typing_extensions import Annotated

def add(left, right):
    """Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in."""
    return left + right

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]  
    extra_field: int
Now our node can be simplified:
def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}  
from langgraph.graph import START

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, "node").compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
​
MessagesState
In practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:
We may wish to update an existing message in the state.
We may want to accept short-hands for message formats, such as OpenAI format.
LangGraph includes a built-in reducer add_messages that handles these considerations:
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]  
    extra_field: int

def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node").compile()
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}  

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [input_message]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
This is a versatile representation of state for applications involving chat models. LangGraph includes a pre-built MessagesState for convenience, so that we can have:
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    extra_field: int
​
Bypass reducers with Overwrite
In some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the Overwrite type for this purpose. When a node returns a value wrapped with Overwrite, the reducer is bypassed and the channel is set directly to that value.
This is useful when you want to reset or replace accumulated state rather than merge it with existing values.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Overwrite
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict
import operator

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def add_message(state: State):
    return {"messages": ["first message"]}

def replace_messages(state: State):
    # Bypass the reducer and replace the entire messages list
    return {"messages": Overwrite(["replacement message"])}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("add_message", add_message)
builder.add_node("replace_messages", replace_messages)
builder.add_edge(START, "add_message")
builder.add_edge("add_message", "replace_messages")
builder.add_edge("replace_messages", END)

graph = builder.compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": ["initial"]})
print(result["messages"])
['replacement message']
You can also use JSON format with the special key "__overwrite__":
def replace_messages(state: State):
    return {"messages": {"__overwrite__": ["replacement message"]}}
When nodes execute in parallel, only one node can use Overwrite on the same state key in a given super-step. If multiple nodes attempt to overwrite the same key in the same super-step, an InvalidUpdateError will be raised.
​
Define input and output schemas
By default, StateGraph operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it’s also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.
When distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.
Below, we’ll see how to define distinct input and output schema.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Define the schema for the input
class InputState(TypedDict):
    question: str

# Define the schema for the output
class OutputState(TypedDict):
    answer: str

# Define the overall schema, combining both input and output
class OverallState(InputState, OutputState):
    pass

# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer
def answer_node(state: InputState):
    # Example answer and an extra key
    return {"answer": "bye", "question": state["question"]}

# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified
builder = StateGraph(OverallState, input_schema=InputState, output_schema=OutputState)
builder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node
builder.add_edge(START, "answer_node")  # Define the starting edge
builder.add_edge("answer_node", END)  # Define the ending edge
graph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph

# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result
print(graph.invoke({"question": "hi"}))
{'answer': 'bye'}
Notice that the output of invoke only includes the output schema.
​
Pass private state between nodes
In some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn’t need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.
Below, we’ll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node_1, node_2 and node_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node_1 and node_2), while the third step (node_3) only has access to the public overall state.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    a: str

# Output from node_1 contains private data that is not part of the overall state
class Node1Output(TypedDict):
    private_data: str

# The private data is only shared between node_1 and node_2
def node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:
    output = {"private_data": "set by node_1"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_1`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 2 input only requests the private data available after node_1
class Node2Input(TypedDict):
    private_data: str

def node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_2"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_2`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 3 only has access to the overall state (no access to private data from node_1)
def node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_3"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_3`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Connect nodes in a sequence
# node_2 accepts private data from node_1, whereas
# node_3 does not see the private data.
builder = StateGraph(OverallState).add_sequence([node_1, node_2, node_3])
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
graph = builder.compile()

# Invoke the graph with the initial state
response = graph.invoke(
    {
        "a": "set at start",
    }
)

print()
print(f"Output of graph invocation: {response}")
Entered node `node_1`:
    Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.
    Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}
Entered node `node_2`:
    Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}
Entered node `node_3`:
    Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}

Output of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
​
Use pydantic models for graph state
A StateGraph accepts a state_schema argument on initialization that specifies the “shape” of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.
In our examples, we typically use a python-native TypedDict or dataclass for state_schema, but state_schema can be any type.
Here, we’ll see how a Pydantic BaseModel can be used for state_schema to add run-time validation on inputs.
Known Limitations
Currently, the output of the graph will NOT be an instance of a pydantic model.
Run-time validation only occurs on inputs to the first node in the graph, not on subsequent nodes or outputs.
The validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.
Pydantic’s recursive validation can be slow. For performance-sensitive applications, you may want to consider using a dataclass instead.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from pydantic import BaseModel

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str

def node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}

# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node
builder.add_edge(START, "node")  # Start the graph with node_1
builder.add_edge("node", END)  # End the graph after node_1
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
Invoke the graph with an invalid input
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": 123})  # Should be a string
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.")
    print(e)
An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]

Runtime Type Coercion

Working with Message Models

​
Add runtime configuration
Sometimes you want to be able to configure your graph when calling it. For example, you might want to be able to specify what LLM or system prompt to use at runtime, without polluting the graph state with these parameters.
To add runtime configuration:
Specify a schema for your configuration
Add the configuration to the function signature for nodes or conditional edges
Pass the configuration into the graph.
See below for a simple example:
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# 1. Specify config schema
class ContextSchema(TypedDict):
    my_runtime_value: str

# 2. Define a graph that accesses the config in a node
class State(TypedDict):
    my_state_value: str

def node(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):  
    if runtime.context["my_runtime_value"] == "a":  
        return {"my_state_value": 1}
    elif runtime.context["my_runtime_value"] == "b":  
        return {"my_state_value": 2}
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unknown values.")

builder = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)  
builder.add_node(node)
builder.add_edge(START, "node")
builder.add_edge("node", END)

graph = builder.compile()

# 3. Pass in configuration at runtime:
print(graph.invoke({}, context={"my_runtime_value": "a"}))  
print(graph.invoke({}, context={"my_runtime_value": "b"}))  
{'my_state_value': 1}
{'my_state_value': 2}

​
Add retry policies
There are many use cases where you may wish for your node to have a custom retry policy, for example if you are calling an API, querying a database, or calling an LLM, etc. LangGraph lets you add retry policies to nodes.
To configure a retry policy, pass the retry_policy parameter to the add_node. The retry_policy parameter takes in a RetryPolicy named tuple object. Below we instantiate a RetryPolicy object with the default parameters and associate it with a node:
from langgraph.types import RetryPolicy

builder.add_node(
    "node_name",
    node_function,
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(),
)
By default, the retry_on parameter uses the default_retry_on function, which retries on any exception except for the following:
ValueError
TypeError
ArithmeticError
ImportError
LookupError
NameError
SyntaxError
RuntimeError
ReferenceError
StopIteration
StopAsyncIteration
OSError
In addition, for exceptions from popular http request libraries such as requests and httpx it only retries on 5xx status codes.
Extended example: customizing retry policies

​
Add node caching
Node caching is useful in cases where you want to avoid repeating operations, like when doing something expensive (either in terms of time or cost). LangGraph lets you add individualized caching policies to nodes in a graph.
To configure a cache policy, pass the cache_policy parameter to the add_node function. In the following example, a CachePolicy object is instantiated with a time to live of 120 seconds and the default key_func generator. Then it is associated with a node:
from langgraph.types import CachePolicy

builder.add_node(
    "node_name",
    node_function,
    cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=120),
)
Then, to enable node-level caching for a graph, set the cache argument when compiling the graph. The example below uses InMemoryCache to set up a graph with in-memory cache, but SqliteCache is also available.
from langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache

graph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())
​
Create a sequence of steps
Prerequisites This guide assumes familiarity with the above section on state.
Here we demonstrate how to construct a simple sequence of steps. We will show:
How to build a sequential graph
Built-in short-hand for constructing similar graphs.
To add a sequence of nodes, we use the add_node and add_edge methods of our graph:
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes
builder.add_node(step_1)
builder.add_node(step_2)
builder.add_node(step_3)

# Add edges
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
We can also use the built-in shorthand .add_sequence:
builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
Why split application steps into a sequence with LangGraph?

​
Create branches
Parallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and conditional_edges. Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you.
​
Run graph nodes in parallel
In this example, we fan out from Node A to B and C and then fan in to D. With our state, we specify the reducer add operation. This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See the above section on state reducers for more detail on updating state with reducers.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Parallel execution graph
With the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated.
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "foo"}})
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
In the above example, nodes "b" and "c" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. Because they are in the same step, node "d" executes after both "b" and "c" are finished.
Importantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them.
Exception handling?

Set max concurrency You can control the maximum number of concurrent tasks by setting max_concurrency in the configuration when invoking the graph.
graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"}, {"configurable": {"max_concurrency": 10}})
​
Defer node execution
Deferring node execution is useful when you want to delay the execution of a node until all other pending tasks are completed. This is particularly relevant when branches have different lengths, which is common in workflows like map-reduce flows.
The above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one branch had more than one step? Let’s add a node "b_2" in the "b" branch:
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def b_2(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B_2" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B_2"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(b_2)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d, defer=True)  
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")
builder.add_edge("b_2", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Deferred execution graph
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "B_2" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2']
In the above example, nodes "b" and "c" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. We set defer=True on node d so it will not execute until all pending tasks are finished. In this case, this means that "d" waits to execute until the entire "b" branch is finished.
​
Conditional branching
If your fan-out should vary at runtime based on the state, you can use add_conditional_edges to select one or more paths using the graph state. See example below, where node a generates a state update that determines the following node.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    # Add a key to the state. We will set this key to determine
    # how we branch.
    which: str

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"], "which": "c"}  

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("b", END)
builder.add_edge("c", END)

def conditional_edge(state: State) -> Literal["b", "c"]:
    # Fill in arbitrary logic here that uses the state
    # to determine the next node
    return state["which"]

builder.add_conditional_edges("a", conditional_edge)  

graph = builder.compile()
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Conditional branching graph
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print(result)
Adding "A" to []
Adding "C" to ['A']
{'aggregate': ['A', 'C'], 'which': 'c'}
Your conditional edges can route to multiple destination nodes. For example:
def route_bc_or_cd(state: State) -> Sequence[str]:
    if state["which"] == "cd":
        return ["c", "d"]
    return ["b", "c"]
​
Map-Reduce and the send API
LangGraph supports map-reduce and other advanced branching patterns using the Send API. Here is an example of how to use it:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Send
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class OverallState(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    subjects: list[str]
    jokes: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]
    best_selected_joke: str

def generate_topics(state: OverallState):
    return {"subjects": ["lions", "elephants", "penguins"]}

def generate_joke(state: OverallState):
    joke_map = {
        "lions": "Why don't lions like fast food? Because they can't catch it!",
        "elephants": "Why don't elephants use computers? They're afraid of the mouse!",
        "penguins": "Why don't penguins like talking to strangers at parties? Because they find it hard to break the ice."
    }
    return {"jokes": [joke_map[state["subject"]]]}

def continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):
    return [Send("generate_joke", {"subject": s}) for s in state["subjects"]]

def best_joke(state: OverallState):
    return {"best_selected_joke": "penguins"}

builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node("generate_topics", generate_topics)
builder.add_node("generate_joke", generate_joke)
builder.add_node("best_joke", best_joke)
builder.add_edge(START, "generate_topics")
builder.add_conditional_edges("generate_topics", continue_to_jokes, ["generate_joke"])
builder.add_edge("generate_joke", "best_joke")
builder.add_edge("best_joke", END)
graph = builder.compile()
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Map-reduce graph with fanout
# Call the graph: here we call it to generate a list of jokes
for step in graph.stream({"topic": "animals"}):
    print(step)
{'generate_topics': {'subjects': ['lions', 'elephants', 'penguins']}}
{'generate_joke': {'jokes': ["Why don't lions like fast food? Because they can't catch it!"]}}
{'generate_joke': {'jokes': ["Why don't elephants use computers? They're afraid of the mouse!"]}}
{'generate_joke': {'jokes': ['Why don't penguins like talking to strangers at parties? Because they find it hard to break the ice.']}}
{'best_joke': {'best_selected_joke': 'penguins'}}
​
Create and control loops
When creating a graph with a loop, we require a mechanism for terminating execution. This is most commonly done by adding a conditional edge that routes to the END node once we reach some termination condition.
You can also set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of supersteps that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits here.
Let’s consider a simple graph with a loop to better understand how these mechanisms work.
To return the last value of your state instead of receiving a recursion limit error, see the next section.
When creating a loop, you can include a conditional edge that specifies a termination condition:
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)

def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if termination_condition(state):
        return END
    else:
        return "b"

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
graph = builder.compile()
To control the recursion limit, specify "recursionLimit" in the config. This will raise a GraphRecursionError, which you can catch and handle:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    graph.invoke(inputs, {"recursion_limit": 3})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
Let’s define a graph with a simple loop. Note that we use a conditional edge to implement a termination condition.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# Define nodes
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)

# Define edges
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
graph = builder.compile()
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Simple loop graph
This architecture is similar to a ReAct agent in which node "a" is a tool-calling model, and node "b" represents the tools.
In our route conditional edge, we specify that we should end after the "aggregate" list in the state passes a threshold length.
Invoking the graph, we see that we alternate between nodes "a" and "b" before terminating once we reach the termination condition.
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']
​
Impose a recursion limit
In some applications, we may not have a guarantee that we will reach a given termination condition. In these cases, we can set the graph’s recursion limit. This will raise a GraphRecursionError after a given number of supersteps. We can then catch and handle this exception:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node C sees ['A', 'B']
Node D sees ['A', 'B']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
Recursion Error

​
Async
Using the async programming paradigm can produce significant performance improvements when running IO-bound code concurrently (e.g., making concurrent API requests to a chat model provider).
To convert a sync implementation of the graph to an async implementation, you will need to:
Update nodes use async def instead of def.
Update the code inside to use await appropriately.
Invoke the graph with .ainvoke or .astream as desired.
Because many LangChain objects implement the Runnable Protocol which has async variants of all the sync methods it’s typically fairly quick to upgrade a sync graph to an async graph.
See example below. To demonstrate async invocations of underlying LLMs, we will include a chat model:
OpenAI
Anthropic
Azure
Google Gemini
AWS Bedrock
HuggingFace
👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docs
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

init_chat_model

Model Class
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

model = init_chat_model("gpt-4.1")
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph

async def node(state: MessagesState):  
    new_message = await llm.ainvoke(state["messages"])  
    return {"messages": [new_message]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node")
graph = builder.compile()

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
result = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [input_message]})  
Async streaming See the streaming guide for examples of streaming with async.
​
Combine control flow and state updates with Command
It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        # state update
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        # control flow
        goto="my_other_node"
    )
We show an end-to-end example below. Let’s create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.
import random
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Literal
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START
from langgraph.types import Command

# Define graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

# Define the nodes

def node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]:
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["b", "c"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "b":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        # this is the state update
        update={"foo": value},
        # this is a replacement for an edge
        goto=goto,
    )

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "c"}
We can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn’t have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside node_a.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_a")
builder.add_node(node_a)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)
# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!

graph = builder.compile()
You might have noticed that we used Command as a return type annotation, e.g. Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that node_a can navigate to node_b and node_c.
from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
Command-based graph navigation
If we run the graph multiple times, we’d see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})
Called A
Called C
​
Navigate to a node in a parent graph
If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )
Let’s demonstrate this using the above example. We’ll do so by changing nodeA in the above example into a single-node graph that we’ll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.
State updates with Command.PARENT When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that’s shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you’re updating in the parent graph state. See the example below.
import operator
from typing_extensions import Annotated

class State(TypedDict):
    # NOTE: we define a reducer here
    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]  

def node_a(state: State):
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        update={"foo": value},
        goto=goto,
        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph
        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph
        graph=Command.PARENT,  
    )

subgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, "node_a").compile()

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    # NOTE: since we've defined a reducer, we don't need to manually append
    # new characters to existing 'foo' value. instead, reducer will append these
    # automatically (via operator.add)
    return {"foo": "b"}  

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": "c"}  

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph")
builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)

graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})
Called A
Called C
​
Use inside tools
A common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={"my_custom_key": "foo", "messages": [...]}) from the tool:
@tool
def lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions."""
    user_info = get_user_info(config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id"))
    return Command(
        update={
            # update the state keys
            "user_info": user_info,
            # update the message history
            "messages": [ToolMessage("Successfully looked up user information", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]
        }
    )
You MUST include messages (or any state key used for the message history) in Command.update when returning Command from a tool and the list of messages in messages MUST contain a ToolMessage. This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).
If you are using tools that update state via Command, we recommend using prebuilt ToolNode which automatically handles tools returning Command objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you’re writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate Command objects returned by the tools as the update from the node.
​
Visualize your graph
Here we demonstrate how to visualize the graphs you create.
You can visualize any arbitrary Graph, including StateGraph.
Let’s have some fun by drawing fractals :).
import random
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

class MyNode:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    def __call__(self, state: State):
        return {"messages": [("assistant", f"Called node {self.name}")]}

def route(state) -> Literal["entry_node", END]:
    if len(state["messages"]) > 10:
        return END
    return "entry_node"

def add_fractal_nodes(builder, current_node, level, max_level):
    if level > max_level:
        return
    # Number of nodes to create at this level
    num_nodes = random.randint(1, 3)  # Adjust randomness as needed
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        nm = ["A", "B", "C"][i]
        node_name = f"node_{current_node}_{nm}"
        builder.add_node(node_name, MyNode(node_name))
        builder.add_edge(current_node, node_name)
        # Recursively add more nodes
        r = random.random()
        if r > 0.2 and level + 1 < max_level:
            add_fractal_nodes(builder, node_name, level + 1, max_level)
        elif r > 0.05:
            builder.add_conditional_edges(node_name, route, node_name)
        else:
            # End
            builder.add_edge(node_name, END)

def build_fractal_graph(max_level: int):
    builder = StateGraph(State)
    entry_point = "entry_node"
    builder.add_node(entry_point, MyNode(entry_point))
    builder.add_edge(START, entry_point)
    add_fractal_nodes(builder, entry_point, 1, max_level)
    # Optional: set a finish point if required
    builder.add_edge(entry_point, END)  # or any specific node
    return builder.compile()

app = build_fractal_graph(3)

Mermaid
We can also convert a graph class into Mermaid syntax.
print(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid())

PNG
If preferred, we could render the Graph into a .png. Here we could use three options:
Using Mermaid.ink API (does not require additional packages)
Using Mermaid + Pyppeteer (requires pip install pyppeteer)
Using graphviz (which requires pip install graphviz)
Using Mermaid.Ink
By default, draw_mermaid_png() uses Mermaid.Ink’s API to generate the diagram.
