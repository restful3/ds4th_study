### `langchain` v1.2.0

- **`create_agent`**: Simplified support for provider-specific tool parameters and definitions via a new [`extras`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/tools/#langchain.tools.BaseTool.extras) attribute on [`tools`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/tools). Examples:
  - Provider-specific configuration such as Anthropic's [programmatic tool calling](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#programmatic-tool-calling) and [tool search](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#tool-search).
  - Built-in tools that are executed client-side, as supported by [Anthropic](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#built-in-tools), [OpenAI](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai#responses-api), and other providers.
- Support for strict schema-adherence in agent `response_format` (see [ProviderStrategy](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/structured-output#provider-strategy) docs).

### `langchain-google-genai` v4.0.0

We've re-written the Google GenAI integration to use Google's consolidated Generative AI SDK, which provides access to the Gemini API and Vertex AI Platform under the same interface. This includes minimal breaking changes as well as deprecated packages in `langchain-google-vertexai`.

See the full [release notes and migration guide](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-google/discussions/1422) for details.

## Nov 25, 2025

### `langchain` v1.1.0

- [**Model profiles**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/models#model-profiles): Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a `.profile` attribute. These data are derived from [models.dev](https://models.dev), an open source project providing model capability data.
- [**Summarization middleware**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#summarization): Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for context-aware summarization.
- [**Structured output**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/structured-output): [`ProviderStrategy`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/structured-output#provider-strategy) support (native structured output) can now be inferred from model profiles.
- [**`SystemMessage` for `create_agent`**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/custom#working-with-system-messages): Support for passing `SystemMessage` instances directly to `create_agent`'s `system_prompt` parameter, enabling advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks.
- [**Model retry middleware**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#model-retry): New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with configurable exponential backoff.
- [**Content moderation middleware**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#content-moderation): OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and tool results.
